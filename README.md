## 
This project is a Mixed Integer Program (MIP) applied to the Facility Location Problem. This problem involves deciding where to open a facility, such as a factory or warehouse, and allocating customers to them based on a variety of factors such as distance and any costs involved. This project used a simple approach for the factors involved, however future directions for this project will have potentially more factors involved in the optimization process. The data set used for this project was a sample set that I created within the colab environment and not taken from an external source.
